# PartyPay - Mini Project

## Project Description
PartyPay is a web application designed to estimate and share group activity expenses. The application allows users to calculate payments for events without needing to log in. However, without an account, users cannot save their event history. For logged-in users, the platform provides functionality to create events, invite members, and track event history.

Currently, the project is in the **redesign phase**, where additional requirements are being gathered to enhance the user experience and features.

## Features
- **Guest Access**: Users can calculate payments without needing to log in, but event history will not be saved.
- **User Accounts**: Logged-in users can:
  - Create events
  - Invite members
  - Save event history for future reference
- **Event Management**: Users can easily manage multiple events and track how expenses are split among participants.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL, Prisma (ORM)
